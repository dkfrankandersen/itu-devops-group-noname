As denoted in class, we define a software arcitecture as *a tangible machine-readable document created during software development. Examples are requirement specification documents, design documents, source code and executables.* (ISO/IEC 19506:2012 Information technology — Object Management Group Architecture-Driven Modernization (ADM) — Knowledge Discovery Meta-Model (KDM)).

The following is a map of the artifacts and all dependencies for the application.
