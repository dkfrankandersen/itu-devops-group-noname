# 3. Process' Perspective
This chapter describes how we have approached the process of working together in terms of organization of the group and what tools have been used and what implications this might have had.

## Organization, Communication and Interaction
We decided to organize ourselves in a flat structure meaning that we all had the same role. When having to make decisions in our team, we would discuss it collectively. If minor decisions were to be made, we would let the decision be made by the person(s) working on the relevant part(s) of the system. 
For instance when deciding on which service to use we would assign one or two persons to research the services available on the market. This would then present the results of the research for the rest of the group for a decision to be made collectively. In the case of minor services, the decision could be made by a single person.

We did not explicit organize us as a *Scrum* team but we used aspects of it. We worked in sprints, and therefore we did a bit of sprint planning. We used a Kanban/Scrum board to organize the work. We made use of stand-up meetings to get an overview of how we were doing in the team. It is described below(?) how we have used these aspects of Scrum.
