# 3. Process' Perspective

We have widely different weekly schedules so we have not been able to meet in person very often. We have mostly been working distributed - and during the Corona lockdown we have only been working distributed.

Throughout the entire project we have been communicating using Slack. This has allowed us to communicate messages across the team using the public channels but we were also able to send direct messages when needed... Further, Slack has allowed us to communicate both synchronously and asynchronously. Often when working on a task together we would use Zoom, which allowed us to do pair programming.

After each lecture, when the task of the next week has been presented we have a short meeting discussing how to cope with the task. Before the Corona lockdown we met in person after the lecture and during the Corona lockdown we have met in a Zoom meeting. This meeting is a mixture between a scrum stand-up meeting and a sprint planning meeting. We normally discuss any uncertainties of how to solve the task and then we split the task into subtasks, which we can add to our online Kanban board. For the Kanban board we use 'Projects' on Github. Our Kanban board is divided into five categories:
- Backlog: Tasks that we want to complete at some point
- Do next: Tasks that need to be completed in the current sprint/week
- In progress: Tasks that are currently beeing worked on. These tasks are assigned to one or more of us.
- Done: The tasks we have completed.

For the first two weeks we did not use a Kanban board. Using the Kanban board made it much easier to divide the project work. Further, it made it easier to do project work when you only had an hour or two available, as it was easy to choose one of the tasks, complete it and then ... the work. This division of tasks meant that we did not interfere with eachother's work very much. 

Before the lockdown we would also sometimes work on the project together after the lecture. Some tasks were difficult to do alone so we preffered to do them together as a team.
