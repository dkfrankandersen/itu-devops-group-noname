# 2. System's Perspective

**Skal det stå her eller 201? er Node.js et framework? runtime?**
### Choice of Programming lLanguage and Framework
We decided to use Node.js as our ... for this project. In order to decide on the best suitable ... we split some of the most popular options on the market between us and researched their pros and cons indidually. We then presented our results and collectively decided on the best option based on the research. 

One of the frameworks we researched was Ruby on Rails. Ruby on Rails seemed very interesting to us as it was already popular and became increasingly popular. With Ruby on Rails it seems very easy to set up a fairly complex application with very few lines of codes or commands. However, a Ruby on Rails project consists of a large number of files and the framework created many files "behind the scene". "Ruby on Rails is not a minimalist framework, it's a metropolis. One filled with all major institutions needed to run a large, sprawling application like Basecamp or Github or Spotify." We did not feel that we needed a metropolis of a framework for our simple application - we preffered to have a simple and lightweight framework as the application was so small. We found that the time used to understand this framework would be used better elsewhere.

Some of the other frameworks we researched were:
- Crystal with Kemal
- Elixir with phoenix
- Nim with Jester
- Ruby with Sinatra
We found that most of these frameworks were not updated very often or were not often used in production.

We ended up deciding to use Node.js. We found that this ... was simple, efficient and lightweight, which we found to be some of the main criteria for this project. We also found Node.js to be very well documented, which was a positive when using a new ... for most of us. Further, some of the members of our team had some experience with Node.js, which meant that we did not have to spend as much time on adapting to this new ... in the relatively short time we had to translate the system.

### Choice of Database System
Just after translating the system to Node.js we made use of a local Sqlite database. This was not ... . We found that the best options for a database system was either MySQL or Postgres. WHY? When deciding between these two database systems we did not find that many differences for a simple system like ours. Both database systems met our requirements and seemed to be more less equally efficient. We decided on using Postgres as we found it to be better "out of the box" and supports a few more data types, which though might have been relevant for us. Further, Postgres is better at handling concurrency than MySQL, which we thought might be a factor for this kind of system.

The choice of ... and database system turned out to be well made in the sense that we had one of the best performing systems compared to the other groups. The only group with a higher 'latest' was another group using Node.js and Postgres. We also did not have any regrets with the choices over the course of the project.
