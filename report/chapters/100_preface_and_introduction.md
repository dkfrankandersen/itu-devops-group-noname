# 1 Preface and Introduction

## Preface
As part of the course DevOps, Software Evolution and Software Maintenance, BSc + MSc, (in short DevOps course). We, a tema of five computer science master students, were task to convert an existing legacy software system called ITU-MiniTwit, essentially a Twitter clone in the form of a message board, where signed-up users can publish small text, follow/unfollow and enjoy the freeflow of internet communication.

The old system showed signs of decay, slow access, unable to handle the increasing amount of connections and not to forget the security and hassles of maintaining software versions, well past their end-of-life cycle. Something had to be done.

## Introduction
And this is were the DevOps course begins, first forming a group of five students, and then as the couse progress being tasked with conversion, development, operation and maintence of a activly system simulated by ghost users, making use of our system.

So even if our system have only lived for a few month, the experience of having to accommodate the demands of stakeholders and needs of users been very real.

This report will be a view into our work both project and group, the thoughts, the trouble and the 20/20 hindsight of knowing what we should have done instead. And maybe also few thinks related to how a global pandemic interveens with everyday life.
