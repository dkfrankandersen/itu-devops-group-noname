## 3.03 Development process and Tools

Based around our Github, manageing a backlog using the *projects* tab.
The backlog consisted of stage columns *backlog*, *Do next*, *In progress and Done*
As an task or issue ermergede (from sessions demands or as part of the development) a brief desciption was written, and on or multiple persons was assigned to the issue, converting it to an actual ticket under the Github *Issue* tab.

As described in the chapter about our *branch strategy*, individual task was solved on seperate branches before solutions were reviewed, tested and merged into *master* before ending up on the *release branch*.

To keep information at hand for every team member, we choose to use the *Wiki* tab to store project information, guides, progress etc.
Less sensetive information on our public reposetory while confidietial info, like login credentials is keept on our private repo.

For keeping track of progress and helping each other while working on a issue, *Slack* was used for text communication while voice/video communication was done using primarly *Zoom*.

After lockdown made us unable to meet physically we moved our weekly *stand-ups* to *Zoom*, making us able to share progress, work sprite and deal with issue in a more close manner than text. We do miss the times were we could sit together, discuss and work on the project, as it's a more collective way, keeping the focus and applies a stronger bond as a tema.
