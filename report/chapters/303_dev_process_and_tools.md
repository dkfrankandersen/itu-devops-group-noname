## 3.03 Development process and Tools

Presentation of tools? (Zoom, Slack, Github projects/issues)
Måske noget i stil med: 
"We have been using the following tools in our development process...
We assume the reader knows these tools. Otherwise information can be found here..."
Eller kan vi gøre det på en anden måde?

Throughout the project we have been communicating using Slack. This has allowed us to communicate messages across the team using the public channels but we were also able to send direct messages when needed - eg. when working together on a part or the system. Further, Slack has allowed us to communicate both synchronously and asynchronously.

We have widely different weekly schedules so we have not been able to meet in person very often. We have mostly been working distributed - and during the Corona lockdown we have only been working distributed. Following the structure of the course, we would work in one week *sprints* - we were free to work on the project as it suited us indivually during the week as long as we collectively completed the task on time. 

After each lecture, when the task of the next week had been presented, we would have a short meeting discussing how to cope with the task. Before the Corona lockdown we met in person after the lecture and during the Corona lockdown we have met in a Zoom meeting. This meeting is a mixture between a Scrum stand-up meeting and a sprint planning meeting. We normally discuss where we are currently at, any uncertainties of how to solve next week's task and then we split the task into subtasks, which we could add to an online Kanban board. Using an online Kanban board allowed us to get an overview and delegate tasks while working distributed.

For the Kanban board we use *Projects* on Github. Our Kanban board is divided into four categories:
- Backlog: Tasks that we want to complete at some point
- Do next: Tasks that need to be completed in the current sprint/week
- In progress: Tasks that are currently beeing worked on. These tasks are assigned to one or more of us. These tasks are converted to *issues* on Github.
- Done: The tasks we have completed.

For the first two weeks we did not use a Kanban board. Using the Kanban board made it much easier to divide the project work. Further, it made it easier to do project work when you only had an hour or two available, as it was easy to choose one of the tasks, complete it and then share the work with the rest of the team. This division of tasks also meant that we did not interfere with eachother's work very much. Some of the tasks in the course have been quite difficult to split into subtasks that did not need to be solved in a sequence - therefore it was often easier to just be done by a single person - or a few persons working together.

After lockdown made us unable to meet physically we moved our weekly *stand-ups* to *Zoom*, making us able to share progress, work sprite and deal with issue in a more close manner than text. We do miss the times were we could sit together, discuss and work on the project, as it's a more collective way, keeping the focus and applies a stronger bond as a team.

Before the lockdown we would also sometimes work on the project together after the lecture. Some tasks were difficult to do alone so we preffered to do them together as a team or to use pair programming. During the lockdown we used Zoom to work on these tasks. Using the *share screen* functionality we were able to do pair programming even when distributed. 

To keep information at hand for every team member, we choose to use the *Wiki* tab to store project information, guides, progress etc. This allowed to easily find information about the parts of the system that had been worked on by other members of our team - such as what port a service is running on or how two services are connected.
The confidential information such as login credentials is kept on a private repository.
