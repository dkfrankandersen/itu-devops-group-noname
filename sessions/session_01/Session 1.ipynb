    "## 2) Migrate _ITU-MiniTwit_ to run on a modern computer running Ubuntu 18.04.\n",
    "\n",
    "By \"modern computer running Ubuntu 18.04\", we mean your personal computer.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What do you need?\n",
    "\n",
    "  * A modern Python, i.e., version at least 3.7\n",
    "    - Hint: likely the easiest way to install this is via Anaconda (a Python distribution), which comes with many of the required dependencies already installed.\n",
    "    - To install it run (and follow the on screen advice):\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "$ wget https://repo.anaconda.com/archive/Anaconda3-2019.10-Linux-x86_64.sh\n",
    "$ bash ~/Downloads/Anaconda3-2019.10-Linux-x86_64.sh\n",
    "```\n",
    "    - To make use of this Python, either open a new terminal window (and close your current one), or reload your shell configuration by:\n",
    "    ```bash\n",
    "    source ~/.bashrc\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    * Part of the Anaconda distribution is a distribution of the SQLite3 database system, which you can check with:\n",
    "    ```bash\n",
    "    $ sqlite3 --version\n",
    "$ which sqlite3\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "  * A current C compiler, e.g., `gcc`\n",
    "    - Likely it is already part of your Ubuntu installation.\n",
    "    - You can check that, for example with:\n",
    "    ```bash\n",
    "    gcc --version\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    - Since the `flag_tool` is a C program, you have to compile it again to support your processor architecture and operating system.\n",
    "      * `flag_tool` includes `sqlite3.h`, which is likely not yet installed on your system.\n",
    "      * It can be installed (together with the required shared library) via:\n",
    "      ```bash\n",
    "      sudo apt-get install libsqlite3-dev\n",
    "      ```\n",
    "  * Since you will be programming a lot during this project, likely, a code editor comes in handy. Either use one that is installed with your system or:\n",
    "    - In case you like [VSCodium](https://vscodium.com/), you can install it like this:\n",
    "    ```bash\n",
    "wget -qO - https://gitlab.com/paulcarroty/vscodium-deb-rpm-repo/raw/master/pub.gpg | sudo apt-key add - \n",
    "echo 'deb https://gitlab.com/paulcarroty/vscodium-deb-rpm-repo/raw/repos/debs/ vscodium main' | sudo tee --append /etc/apt/sources.list.d/vscodium.list \n",
    "sudo apt update && sudo apt install codium\n",
    "```\n",
    "    - Another small terminal text editor that you might like is the [Micro Editor](https://micro-editor.github.io/), which can be installed as in the following:\n",
    "    ```bash\n",
    "    sudo apt-get install xclip\n",
    "    snap install micro --classic\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "   - To inspect the database file while refactoring, you might want to use a tool to \"look into\" your database file, such as the [DB Browser for SQLite](https://sqlitebrowser.org/), which you can install via:\n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   sudo apt install sqlitebrowser\n",
    "   ```    \n",
    "    \n",
    "### How do I start refactoring _ITU-MiniTwit_?\n",
    "\n",
    "Your task is to modify as few lines as possible in the given sources of _ITU-MiniTwit_, just enough to make it run on your Ubuntu Linux system with a Python 3.7 system.\n",
    "\n",
    "  * You will likely want to make use of the tool `2to3`, which was installed together with Anaconda and which can help you translating Python 2 programs to Python 3 programs.\n",
    "    - You might want to read its help text before using it:\n",
    "    ```bash\n",
    "    2to3 --help\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    - After applying the `2to3` tool compare the original source code of `minitwit.py`, i.e., the one that you received in class from the old server, with the `minitwit.py3` that is generated by the tool.\n",
    "      - You can compare text files with the `diff` command:\n",
    "      ```bash\n",
    "      diff minitwit.py minitwit.py3\n",
    "      ```\n",
    "      - Once you are sure that you understand what the `2to3` tool changed, replace the contents of `minitwit.py` with the Python 3 sources.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "  * **Hint**: \n",
    "    - When converting `minitwit.py` to Python 3 you might receive an error when reading the SQL script when initializing the database in line: `db.cursor().executescript(f.read())`. Likely decoding of the file contents into `utf-8` has to be declared explicitely.\n",
    "    - Make sure to test this code (by running it), which will only be executed when initializing an empty database.\n",
    "  \n",
    "  * Adapt the command in the `Makefile` that builds the `flag_tool`. Likely, the shared library is located in a different place, and after installing `libsqlite3-dev` you might not necessarily have to specify it explicitly.\n",
    "    - Check the runtime dependencies of your compiled `flag_tool` with the `ldd` command:\n",
    "    ```bash\n",
    "    ldd ~/Desktop/itu-minitwit/flag_tool\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "  * Lastly, adapt the shell script `control.sh` according to the recommendations of the tool `shellcheck` (a linter for shell scripts)\n",
    "    ```bash\n",
    "    shellcheck control.sh\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    - You can install the tool via: `sudo apt install shellcheck`\n",
    "\n",
    "### Share your Work on Github\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "  - Create a public repository on Github. \n",
    "    - Either create an organization, which will hold all your work as repositories for this semester, and to which you invite all team members. \n",
    "    - Or, create a public repository for one of you and invite the other team members as collaborators. \n",
    "  - Keep versions of all your refactoring work in that repository.\n",
    "  - Once you are done (and latest by **Wednesday Feb 5th, at 23:59**) [create a release](https://help.github.com/en/github/administering-a-repository/creating-releases) with your refactored version of _ITU-MiniTwit_.\n",
